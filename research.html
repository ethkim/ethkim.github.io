		<h2>Clique Cover on Sparse Networks</h2>

		<p> 
			We consider the problem of edge clique cover on sparse networks and study an application to the identification of overlapping protein complexes for a network of binary protein-protein interactions. We first give an algorithm whose running time is linear in the size of the graph, provided the treewidth is bounded. We then provide an algorithm for planar graphs with bounded branchwidth upon which we build a PTAS for planar graphs. Empirical studies show that our algorithms are both efficient and practical on actual simulated and biological networks, and that the clique covers obtained on real networks yield biological insights.

		<h2>Discovering Direct Protein Interactions </h2>
		<img class="floatleft" width=250px src="./img/directPPI.png" />
		
<p>We first propose a simple probabilistic model for the interactions captured by AP-MS experiments, under which the problem of separating direct interactions from indirect ones is formulated. Then, given idealized quantitative AP-MS data, we study the problem of identifying the most likely set of direct interactions that produced the observed data. We address this challenging graph theoretical problem by first characterizing signatures that can identify weakly connected nodes as well as dense regions of the network. The rest of the direct PPI network is then inferred using a genetic algorithm. Our algorithm shows a good performance on both simulated and biological networks with very high sensitivity and specificity. Then the algorithm is used to predict direct interactions from a set of AP-MS PPI data from yeast, and its performance is measured against a high-quality interaction dataset.

                    We study exact and approximate topological matching of quadrilateral meshes, that is,
                    the problem of finding as large a set as possible of matching
                    portions of two quadrilateral meshes. We show that the problem of
                    producing a maximum approximate topological match of two quad meshes
                    is NP-hard. Further, we provide a "lazy-greedy" 
                    algorithm that is guaranteed to find good matches when mis-matching portions of mesh
                   	are localized. This work was done while visiting

					<p>
					Given a digraph G=(V, A) with direction function d:A->{N,S,E,W,U,D},
                    draw the graph in 3D such that the embedding respects the directions on every arc,
                    and no two edges intersect except at their shared endpoints.
                    We studied two special classes of graphs: paths and cycles, and show a
                    combinatorial characterization for graphs that admit such drawings.

                    in V2 is 4, can G be embedded on a two dimensional grid such that each 
                    vertex in V1 is drawn as a line segment along a grid line, each vertex in V2 
                    is drawn as a point at a grid point, and each edge e = (u, v) for some u in V1

					<h2>Evaluation of Hypergeometric Series</h2>
                    <img class="floatleft" width=150px src="./img/hypergeometric.png" />
                    <p>
                    Many important constants, such as e and Apéry's constant Zeta(3), can be approximated by a 
                    truncated hypergeometric series. The evaluation of such series to high precision has traditionally 
                    been done by binary splitting followed by fixed-point division. However, the numerator and the 
                    denominator computed by binary splitting usually contain a very large common factor. 
                    We apply standard computer algebra techniques including modular computation and rational 
                    reconstruction to overcome the shortcomings of the binary splitting method. 
                    The space complexity of our algorithm is the same as a bound on the size of the reduced numerator and 
                    denominator of the series approximation. Moreover, if the predicted bound is small, the time complexity 
                    is better than the standard binary splitting approach. 
                    Our approach allows a series to be evaluated to a higher precision without additional memory. 
                    We show that when our algorithm is applied to compute Zeta(3), the memory requirement is significantly reduced 
                    compared to the binary splitting approach.

		<h2>Fast Filtering for HMMs in Domain Discovery</h2>
		<img class="floatleft" width=150px src="./img/hmm.png" />
		<p> Hidden Markov Models(hmms) have been very popular tools for domain detection
problem in computational biology. However, when the size of the input data is large,
simple linear searches through the entire database against the hmm are not su¿ciently
fast for realistic applications. In this paper, we propose different methods to accelerate
this process by using techniques from combinatorial data structures and graph theoretic
algorithms.
